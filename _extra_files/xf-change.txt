Started logging at Mon 13 Aug 2001
This date is the start of Beta 6 Development
Really, I've considered logging every change to the code,
and wondered why I didn't do it before.


The first steps of development were: (BL; Before Logging)
o Intro
o Admin password and 'Add Subject' wizzard, later replaced by Admin Center
o Log Files for each day.
o Thought that editing HTML pages all the time was not a solution, so script also used for GET requests
o Error page
o Reading predefined subject Information

- Changes after Beta 1:
o Adding text-only topics and posts, just typing your name was OK.
o Member profiles with register and edit feature
o Name replaced by login name and password in post dialog
X-FORUM RELEASED IN PRIVATE DIRECTORY

- Changes after Beta 2:
o Memberlist
o Login feature with cookies, soon followed with redirect option
o Help Dialogs
o X-Forum.cgi crew and compilation slowed the program down.
o Found a way to use 'require' files, but failed under W2K/IIS5, Solution finally found in CGI programs.
o Forum Split into files, made program very fast! (from 0.30 to 0.15 CPU Time at intro page)

- Changes after Beta 3:
o External Settings File.
o Interface elements contructed by helper routines, so even HTML Outlook was centralized.
o Iconlist Dialog
o Editpost Dialog
o Admin Center with: add subject, edit settings, view (not edit) forum files, view logging files
o XBBC Parser!! - I don't like s/// regexps that slow down because you need 30 of them for all the
  XBBC codes. Damn, the parser is fast anyway. - My Thanks to VB6; you can't program such things in other ways there. :'(
  But real thanks to Perl where you have hashes, flexible English look-a-like code and regexps for nasty pattern matches ;)
o Visitor List (Users Online)
o Editmember can't be accessed without login (you could enter your login info to view it when guest)

- Changes after Beta 4:
o Locktopic Dialog
o Language Packs (English and Dutch)
o Templates; After a great idea how to replace tags in a template without slowing down too much
o New database system.
  - Files are removed, renamed or included into other files
  - Filecontents no longer assigned to list of scalars, but constants are being used now.
  - Sequence in the datafiles don't matter now anymore. The constants make sure the right item is picket out.
o Admin Center: Edit/Sort Subjects, Edit Forum Files

- Changes after Beta 5:
X-FORUM FOR PUBLIC AT PERSONAL HOMEPAGE (http://www.suijker.nl)
o Admin Center: Maintaince Mode, Ban Users/IPs, Censor Words
o Memberlist requires login.
o View-Logging Buttons for administrator
o No more errors dumped in log file when user is admin.

- Changes after Beta 5.1:
o Changing UI; No one uses all the functions (like icon dialog), it's not clear what to do and where.
o Rewriting help files
o Deleted Buttons that can be accessed by moderators only (were visible when not logged on)
o Add post/Add Topic/Lock topic/Edit post not accessable when not logged in (makes things easier, but cookie support is really required now!)
o Added option to hide Add post/Add topic/Quote post buttons when user is guest
o The x-forum.txt was written and so this document.
o Membergroups + Admin control center
o Made private subjects possible (for some member-groups only)
o Footer files not loaded every time when member information is requested.
o Timezone in Member Profile and option to show them in the admin center.
o Cool new Error page
  - All errors are trapped.
  - Tries to use the template or shows default page with (in BEGIN or compile errors mostly; when nothing is loaded yet)
  - Does not do anything in a eval call.
o Parts in General Section Hidden for Guests in Member Profile
o Setting Added: Guests may not see any e-mail addresses
o Setting Added: Limit view for (eg. member profile); don't show any of the empty fields.
o Post Flood Protection: Same member can't post for a while.
o Fixed some JS/HTML/Displaying errors that only occured in Netscape
  - missing // before --></SCRIPT> (causes syntax errros)
  - function doesn't always return a value warning (not in IE!)
  - Invalid HTML in the ?show=topic page
  - Removed the "cross-browser" fader in NS because the everything bolow it vanished!!, when it was drawn (except for the horizontal and table lines)
o Some visual problems couldn't be fixed (due NS 4.7 bugs!):
  - <NOBR>...</NOBR> text in tables exceeds the table cell width (will be drawn over the next cell)
  - Table cell widths aren't calculated correctly, when using a combination of fixed- and variable-width cells.
  - A empty <TD></TD> cell won't be drawn at all (so you see the background through the table)
  - The separator lines between the table rows/cols aren't draw at all (so you see the background through the table)
  - Input fields with CCS codes from my template (width and border) won't draw correctly; border is drawn elsewhere and smaller, fields aren't positioned correctly
o Added mailer to script.
o Welcome e-mail can be received.
o Added MSN icon, should be changed anyway (I don't know the link to a user's location yet)
o Added YIM online icon.
o Bugfix: No infinite loop caused anymore when <IMG onError=""> sets a URL that couldn't be found aswell.
o Same error only printed once in the log files.
o Added 'NEW' icons in subject-select page aswell.
o Added TRAP_ERRORS constant to x-forum.cgi
o Posts can be deleted!!
  - Member-post-status is not affected; e.g. an experienced-poster/user won't loose his status then when all it's posts are lost.
o Topics can be deleted!!
o Rearranged some code.
  - Reading in the subject/topic information and security checks are now done at module load, not when executing a subroutine.
o Fixed complex-security problems
  - Rearranging the code helped my solving them.
  - Problems usually where:
    - Tested login, moderator access, but forgot to check the password aswell.
    - Tests being done when displaying the dialog, but not when doing the execution of the dialog (in POST request)
  - Normal users won't get advantage of these errors.
  - Errors are usable only when sending manual POST headers to this script.
o Changed HTML conversion. All one-byte special ASCII chars are replaced now.
Actually, every file has been changed in the forum! Just look at the mod list, and you know that aswell.
o Added last login date
o Fixed problem with default number of entries in database files
o Added e-mail checks to member database routines (e-mail addresses can't be lost now, they were erased when user=guest and $GUEST_NOMAIL is set)
o Added online status icon to posts.
o Fixed security problem. The administrator sees very much, so his cookie is always checked.
o Added IP address to post info; it's seen by the administrator
o Variable $BACK_COLOR replaced by $CELL_COLOR, $BACK_COLOR used as alternative (such as error pages)
o Some shared libaries upgraded to modules; XProgramming::*::*
o Fixed problem with admin edit dialogs when no subjects/groups are available to edit
o Password access errors won't be saved in member's personal logfile. It could be someone else trying it!!
o Moved some TemplateSetReplace code in html_template.pl so the template is displayed better when a run-error occures the print_header_HTML is called.
o Fixed some problems with the administrator login (when admin.mbr doesn't exist). The admin logged in, and got an error later it's memberfile didn't exist.
o Upgraded some code into modules, for easier use by my other CGI scripts.
o Limited Editing Capabilities in the Admin Edit Forum Files Window.


- Changes after Release 1.0:
o Fixed 500 Server Error problem; The date and expires HTTP fields were printed twice, because of the CGI::cache call (which replaces the -expires => 'now' field).
o Fixed database files for large topics.
  - Only the displayed posts on the page are now loaded from the .pst files
  - Any subroutine will now receive a reference instead of an copy of the posts array.
  - It appears to speed things really up with large topics.
o Added javascript prompt dialog to XBBC toolbar buttons when text-insertion is not supported.
o Fixed problem with javascript hover effect in the XBBC toolbar buttons. There is also a soft hack fix in html_xbbcedit.pl available.
o Fixed problem with <TEXTAREA></TEXTAREA> in netscape. Netscape can't handle a closing tag followed directly (without a space or breakl) after the opening tag.
o Administrator e-mail can't be hidden, but yet no error message is displayed when you try to hide it.
o Security Fix: directories named . or .. can't be viewed in the forum file browser
o Changed <FORM> printing, every form is now printed by other subroutines
o Cleared up the admin file browser. Any bugs caused by bad readable code are now fixed.
o Moving a topic is not allowed when there is only one subject available.
o Confirmation and XBBC Editor Dialog fixed.
  - If user A requests receives the confirm/xbbcedit dialog,
    and then user B changes the forum language,
    and then user A submits the confirm/xbbcedit dialog, it failed.
o Added Icons to posts and topics (that wasn't implemented yet)
o Added JavaScript checks to the input fields
o Fixed 500 problem when the last post from a topic is deleted.
o XBBC Convertor can handle smileys that look simular, like ::) and :) They are also added.
o Attempted to speed up the XBBC Convertor a bit more. Not all regexps predefined by qr// worked :'(
o Code clearup
o Fixed some more problems when the last topic is moved from a subject
  - The topic wan't added to the destiny subject table
  - Considering: (not implemented) The old subject statistics should be made empty...?
o Speed up the sorting of the memberlist dialog
o Fixed a small problem with the display of icons in the iconlist dialog, if there are also other files found in the directory.
o Speed up the iconlist dialog, using a grep between the sort reading construction.

- Changes after Release 1.1:
o Fixed problem with dlg_addmember.pl. Any registration ended with a error about e-mailing.
o Changed the member topic-view-times files (.lat) into (.lxs).
  - Only the required data is loaded now, not the entire file anymore
  - These files are binary, do download them BINARY aswell.
o Fixed problem with log files. The data wasn't written correctly in it
  - Script errors should only be printed once in the log.
o Fixed problem with memberlist. Typooes I hate them!!!
o Fixed copy-paste problem in Admin: Edit subjecs. After saving, the wrong subroutine was called ;(
o Smileys are converted earier, so they don't ruin the HTML code generated by the XBBC code parser.
o The wrong version of xbbcodes.cfg was released. This file was also updated, but not copied to my release version
o Added some color settings to xf-settings.pl Every color in the forum can now be changed!
o Moved the extra toolbar buttons to the right, this implies you need to edit your template.
o At the script startup, all settings not filled in will be filled in anyway.
o The admin settings will use the current values of the settings, if you don't pass one of the arguments.

- Changes after Release 1.2:
o JavaScript Error in Edit Member groups, when you agreed to save changes to a group, before switching to another group.
o Changed the sprint_selectfield_HTML routine for printing <SELECT> boxes
o Changed the dialogs, so you can select the membernames, instead of typing in the login names.
o Changed edit subject/group
  - This dialog doesn't corrupt subjects/groups anymore when JavaScript is turned off. (after playing with the <SELECT> box)
  - The dialog box can be used when you don't have JavaScript, but it's very difficult to handle.
o Updated post preview.
  - This looks identical to the actual result.
  - In fact, it shares the same routines used to display a topic.
o You can view the icon selected in the icon select box now.
o The post-flood is also tested if you edit a post.
o Fixed problem with post-flood. The flood was tested after the topic file was created.
o Fixed minor bug with XBBC convertor. A [quotepost=0]...[/] did not produce the expected result (ie. display 'Quote' instead)
o Added Instant Messaging!
o Moved some unused icons to the posticons folder.
o Edited some posticons. Their size wasn't 16x16.
o Changed the login check procedure. The crypt-password was sent with the QUERY_STRING !!!
o Fixed problem with $FORUM_ISOLATED variable. The cookies didn't have the correct path.
o Added 'NEW' icons to the post headers in the topic window, if the post is new.
o Added statistics; number of members, topics, posts
  - Number of topics will be fixed when the subject index page is requested
  - Number of members and posts will be fixed when the memberlist is requested
o Fixed bugs in the delete post routines.
  - Some statistics of the topic were mixed up.
  - The rest of the forum code made some expectations, based on the wrong statistics
  - Sometimes, new posted replies in such topics weren't displayed because of this...!!
o Fixed topic display problem: all posts will be displayed, even if the statisics are incorrect...
o Log files will no longer be created if the log folder does not exist.
o Fixed a error-detection problem in the e-mail sender from the 'signup' page.
o Added subject categories.
o Updated the look of the admin center.
o Attempted to change the password crypting algorithm
  However, this feature has been disabled. Not every webserver has the complex Digest::SHA1 module installed.
  At my local testserver, every password was converted at the login (unless you're the admin).
o Fixed the size of the topic status icons.
o Added sticky topics.
o Fixed a error-detection problem in the language packs.
o Added online icon to the memberlist internet column

o Added 'Banned' icon to the post footer, at the location where normally the 'Online' icon would appear.

- Changes after Release 1.3:
o Added repair files option to admin center
o Removed $| from the settings file. This is now always 1. (1=line-buffering, 0=block-buffering)
o Fixed a problem with the constants in the intialize.pl module
o The memberlist never changes the postnum stats anymore. Use the repair options for this.
o The new module Test::IPAddress is used now.
  - An IP address like (145.ha.ha.*) is no longer accepted in the admin ban users dialog.
  - The client IP address can be determined on many more webservers now.
o Reordered the admin center functions 
o Made the database routines even more safer.
  - The id's passed from the QUERY_STRING won't be used directly, but will be converted,
    so there isn't any change anymore that an user get's information from the webserver through
    a strange QUERY_STRING, or abuses it, although that was very difficult already.
    Sample in windows: "x-forum.cgi?show=...&member=admin| erase C:\ *.*| echo "  (note the | symbol)
o Added pasing of URL's in the post text:
  - You no longer need to put the [url]..[/] codes arround an URL to make it look like a hyperlink
  - A www.site.com URL will be converted to http://www.site.com
  - [url]www.site.com[/url] will be converted to [url=http://www.site.com]www.site.com[/url] (same for [email] code)

o Added pre-loading of images for message icons.
o The log files are better sorted now in the Admin: log files dialog.
o Made the log files display better
o Added a settings file (logactions.cfg).
  - That file defined what actions should be logged, or not.
  - Any action not defined there will be logged!
o Added logging for the 'Maintaince mode' actions
o (Re)wrote help files
  - New features were added, but not documentated in the forum help files.
  - Redisigned the help topics index page
  - Adjusted some help documentation, because of changes in using the forum

  - Fully OO Module.
  - Easier to work with read+write files.

o Added test to repair database: when the post file is 0 kb (occured to me when I caused an error in the add-post routine)
o Removed abuse of javascript: URL's in [image=...] and [url=...] tags.
o Fixed some things with directory removal from the admin file browser.
  - Browser was redirected to directory that was just removed!
  - Bad query string could make x-forum do strange things (putting a / at the end)

  - You may edit your last post once without being tested for flooding.

- Changes after Release 1.4:
o Added e-mail validation test to the MSN field of the user profiles

  - Added sorting options to memberlist (sorting is done in an intelligent way, not just by literally comparing 2 values)
  - Added 'date' field to the memberlist (filled with "register", "last post" or "last login" date)
  - E-mail address is not displayed anymore. It was useless, (unless you're a spammer) so just consuming space
  - Fixed AIM icon: it used the YIM address.
  - When the member has posted something, a bar will always be displayed (even if posts/topposts < 0.5%)
o Fixed things for member website/email/msn/icq/aim/yim icons

o Renamed UBBC into XBBC. (the U doesn't stand for Universal, for but for Ultimate BB Codes)
o Fixed problem with missing information when editing posts.
o Fixed problem with topic display when a poster's profile was not found ("member not exist").
o Fixed problem with smiley conversions. >D and "D resulted into grin smilies, because it that code was converted to &gt;D or &quot;D first. (includes the ;D smiley)
o Removed subsitutions for the words x-forum and xforum from the bad list.
o Removed [pre] code. [code] .. [/code] is used for this now.
o Added [nomarkup] .. [/nomarkup] code.
o Rewrote the XBBC processor, and included some speedup fixes. The code became too complex, and properly won't be able to handle very large posts.
o Attempted to speed up modules (70% of the CPU usage is used for loading)
  - Speed up for CGI::Location.
o Updated the IP address test in the Test::IPAddress module.
o Added cool splitter function to the XBBC processor.
  - Using quotes arround the parameters, makes all characters inside it literal
  - for example, here [image=test.gif,16,16,"Hello, there"] the last comma is
    ignored, since there are "quotes" put arround the parameters.
  - The quotes arround parameters will be removed.
  - Use ""double quotes"" to display quotes arround the test.
  - This feature does not apply to quotes that are typed in
    the middle of a parameter, like [image=test.gif,16,16,Not "l,iteral"]
    Here, the final 2 parameters are seen as <not "l> and <iteral">.
o Optimized the notification e-mail sender for Net::SMTP usage. (for every 200 e-mails, it only uses one Net::SMTP connection)

- Changes after Release 1.5:

    - URL's are automatically clickable now
    - javascript codes in [image=javascript:] and [url=.. are disabled.
    - [url=mailto:..] links converted to [email] links 
    - links,images that don't start with http:// are automatically fixed.
    - empty [url]www.site.com[/url] codes converted correctly now again. (normally, only [url=http://www.site.com]my site[/url] is accepted)
o Removed the last <P> tag from the template.
o Added flexible version checks, so different (but compatible) file versions won't be rejected.
o Fixed sorting of timezone entries (in edit profile) for Perl versions below 5.005
o Changed "large font" entry for tables. (index page has a larger font now)

- Changes after Release 1.5 Revision 1:
o Using [row] or [|] outside a [table] tag is disallowed now. (which closed parent tables too early at the page)
o XBBC converter handles "must-ignore" closing codes better (ie. codes must be ignored when the opening code is ignored)

o Added more info field to member profiles (to show personal info, interests)
o Added extra security check to member profiles.
  - When accessing the profile (not as guest), your password cookie is validated,
    since the profile displays more personal info when you're not a guest.
o Added "Remember Me" option to login window.
  - This will keep you logged in for one month.
  - Your password will be rechecked when you're not listed in the who's online list anymore.

  - x-forum.cgi?show=about now redirects to x-forum.cgi?show=help&help=about
o Changed automatic post title for quotes posts (the title of the quoted post is used now)

o Updated help files with new features
o Moved several icons from the /x-images/folders/ directory to new folders.

o Removed template colors from "Admin Edit Settings" option.

o Fixed problem in post window, which occured when a second <FORM> is included in the HTML template.
o Fixed XBBC param splitting.
  - Using " " in a param list works at it should be, ie.
    [quote="Hello, there"] will not be split into 2 arguments,
    but [quote=Hello "D*", ehhh.] will be split into <Hello "D*"> and < ehhh.>
  - This changed, because some sequences in converting XBBC have been changed too.
  - The x-data/forum folder is used now.
o Fixed "total number of posts" statistics, which wasn't updated correctly when a topic (having replies) was deleted.
o Fixed maintaince problem. You still got the maintaince message when logging in as admin and your previous visited page was the logout window.
o Fixed sorting for Member names and group names in multiselect boxes, now sorted at name (not ID)
o The view-Your-Profile button does disappeared when you viewed another member's profile
o Delayed the moment of loading  for all the post icons that are pre-loaded in the posting window.
o Fixed bad HTML usage at instant message dialog (visibility problem in netscape)
o Fixed some title text for smiley toolbar in post window.
o Fixed JavaScript code in NO buttons of HTML-confirm dialogs, when the dialog was accessed directly.
o Fixed repair database detecton of "topics that don't refer back to their real parent subject" (ie. "general" lists "topic 12", but "topic 12" says it's listed in "help")
  - A perl error message appeared, instead of the notification that should be printed.
  - After this, the topic wasn't added to the target subject-listing (but was removed from the original subject-listing)
o Fixed problems with e-mailing through sendmail.
  - Message "Bad Constant Used"
  - Unexpected Errors sometimes
  - Admin center had problems with sendmail path validation
o Maybe Fixed slow reply-posting at Win32 with Perl version less then 5.6

o Attempted to add DHTML input-dialogs to the post window XBBC buttons.
  - The code is available, but disabled, because IE6 crashed by it!
  - To activate the DHTML dialogs, run this command from the location bar:
    javascript:void(XBBC_DO_DHTML=1)
  - To make IE6 crash, open a dialog (press font-color for example), scroll the browser-window, press close, go to another page.
o Attempted to add support for 'blat' to the e-mailer.
  - The code can be activated by setting $MAIL_TYPE to 3.
  - For some reason, the code works in Perl, but not in an CGI environment?

O Fixed JavaScript e-mail validation function: x.yyyy@zzz.com is accepted now too. (the dot as second character)
o Fixed "use of undefined value" value message when something failed with e-mailing (in initialize.pl)
o Fixed iconlist error messages that occured when the membericon folder contained unexpected filenames
  - A X-Forum message appears when the membericons folder is not found (not a perl exception)
  - Icons who don't match the "subject-name.ext" pattern will also be displayed now, instead of causing errors. (in extra group).
  - Icons having a number, like "subject01.ext" will be grouped automatically in subjects too.
o Fixed simular problem with the smileylist (better message when smileys folder can't be found)
o Fixed the bug in the subject add/edit dialogs: linebreaks are now removed from the description box.
o Fixed possible bug in memberlist sorting. (sorting doesn't fail with bad data...)
